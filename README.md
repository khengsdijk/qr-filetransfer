A small command line utility program that allows a user to send a file to their phone over wifi.
Other functionalities are sending files from your phone to your computer and exchange text
with  a very basic google docs like idea. 

This is still a work in progress especially the exchanging text part.

I am planning to add some configuration options and options for larger file transfers.

To install run mvn install or run it in your IDE.

A small note the QR code gets a bit stretched out when using IntelliJ

the program use is quite straightforward once it has been started.

simply choose the desired options and follow the instructions on the terminal.
